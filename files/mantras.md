# Important Things That I Need To Remind Myself Of
#### If it is important, write it down
Communicating important information which you possess, purely verbally, means that everyone has forgotten everything by tomorrow, and every time someone else needs to acquire the same information they have to come to you.

#### Perfect is the enemy of good

Soo worrying about not being productive enough is... Counterproductive.
